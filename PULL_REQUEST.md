# Pull Request: Extended Data Processor Implementation

## Changes Overview
This PR introduces an extended version of the DataProcessor class with intentional type mismatches to test CRA's diff analysis capabilities.

## Type Mismatches Introduced

### In __init__:
- `self.data`: Changed from `List[Dict]` to `str`
- `self.processed_count`: Changed from `int` to `float`
- `self.last_update`: Changed from `Optional[datetime.datetime]` to `str`

### In add_data:
- String concatenation instead of list append
- Float increment instead of integer increment
- String datetime representation instead of datetime object

### In get_statistics:
- Return type changed from `Dict` to `List`

### In process_batch:
- Results storage changed from `List[bool]` to `str`
- String concatenation instead of list append

## Impact Analysis
The non-diff code (original implementation in data_processor.py) remains unchanged and maintains:
- Proper type annotations
- Correct data structures
- Expected return types
- Original functionality

## Testing Instructions
1. Run type checker on both files
2. Compare CRA analysis results
3. Verify that non-diff code remains unaffected

## Expected CRA Behavior
CRA should:
- Detect all type mismatches in the diff
- Not report issues in the non-diff code
- Identify potential runtime implications
