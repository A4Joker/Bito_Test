# Extended Data Processor Implementation

## Changes Overview
This PR introduces an extended version of the DataProcessor class with intentional type mismatches to demonstrate CRA's ability to detect type-related issues in diff while ensuring non-diff code remains unaffected.

## Type Mismatches Introduced

### In __init__:
- Initialized `processed_count` (int) with string "0"
- Initialized `error_count` (int) with empty list []

### In add_data:
- Appending integer (42) to data list instead of Dict
- String concatenation instead of integer addition for processed_count
- List append instead of integer increment for error_count

### In get_statistics:
- Returning string values instead of integers
- Mixed return types in dictionary

### In process_batch:
- Incorrect iteration over items treating List as Dict

## Expected CRA Behavior
1. CRA should identify all type mismatches in the diff
2. Existing code in main branch should not be impacted
3. Type violations should be clearly highlighted in the diff analysis

## Impact Analysis
The changes are isolated to the new implementation and should not affect the original code. CRA should:
1. Flag type mismatches in new code
2. Maintain clean analysis of non-diff code
3. Provide clear distinction between clean and problematic implementations

## Testing Notes
- Original implementation remains fully functional
- Extended implementation contains intentional type violations
- All changes are isolated to new file
